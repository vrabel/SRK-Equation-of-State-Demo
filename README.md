# SRK Equation of State Demo
This project is the first in series of exercises as part of the course **Programming for Chemical Engineering Applications** taught at the
University of Notre Dame by [Jeffery Kantor](https://github.com/jckantor).

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the **Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation** of state with a small, nonpolar molecule at a set pressure and temperature, solving for the molar volume. The intended audience is first or second year engineers who want to see how changing the appropriate parameters affects the P-T or P-V plots.

$$P = $$
