# SRK-Equation-of-State-Demo
This project is the first in series of exercises as part of the course **Programming for Chemical Engineering Applications** taught at the
University of Notre Dame by [Jeffery Kantor](https://github.com/jckantor}.

The goal of this project is to demonstrate the Soave-Redlich-Kwong equation of state with a small, nonpolar molecule at a set pressure and 
temperature, solving for the molar volume.
